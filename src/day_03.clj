  Vocab:
  - engine schematic: visual repr of an engine, consisting of numbers, symbols and dots
  - adjacent - right next to horizontally, vertically or diagonally
  - part number - any number adjacent to a symbol
  - gear - a * symbol adjacent to exactly two part numbers

  How to represent data?
  - approach 1: 2D matrix
  - approach 2: seq of lines, with the context of prev and next line
  - approach 3: maps of numbers with their positions
  Approach 2 chosen, parsing & checking for adjacent symbols seems easiest here

  Excluded:
  - tests (relied on comments and REPL only)
  - final refactoring

  Learnings before checking other solutions:
  - In Part1, data was structured around numbers and their context.
    Part2, however, required structure around a particular symbol, which
    needed extra modelling
  - I've chosen an approach to always-be-adding to existing maps, which in this
    case made it easier to build the logic.
  - I keep forgetting about fn signatures, maybe it's time for Anki

  Learnings after checking other solutions:
  - Looking at solution at Clojurian Slack, the chosen representation was not optimal,
    and I have ended up with quite a bloated code
  - There's (dec x) and (inc x) functions
  - (for) allows :let and :when, that would be useful https://gitlab.com/maximoburrito/advent2023/-/blob/main/src/day03/main.clj?ref_type=heads#L139
  - tools missing in my arsenal: reduce-kv, mapcat, loop https://elken.github.io/aoc/src/solutions/2023/day03/
